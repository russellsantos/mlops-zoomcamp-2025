# Overview

This document serves as my notes as I go through the videos in this module. This will be a bit disorganized, as I will just note down what I need to.

I will be watching each video, and try to code along, so that I can get the practice. I will also be adding any issues I went through ,and how I resolved them. 

After I go through each video, I will be going through the homework, and taking notes as well.
